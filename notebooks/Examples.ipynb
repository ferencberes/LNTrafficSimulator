From a node's position in the network `lnsimulator` can estimate the base fee increment needed to achieve optimal routing by setting `with_node_removals=True` and calling `calc_optimal_base_fee` function afterwards. **For now optimal base fee search is enabled only for cheapest path routing (`weight=\"total_fee`). We also recommend you apply parallelization by setting a higher value for the `max_threads` parameter.**"
